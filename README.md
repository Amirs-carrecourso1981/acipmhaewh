Just came out of Bullet Train Explosion, brain still buzzing like a hive of bees on a tractor. The theater was like, super noisy, popcorn stuck in my teeth, still crunching bits as I type this. Wow, though, what a ride. Like, okay, first off, explosions were as non-stop as Grandma’s yammering on Thanksgiving dinner – dude, would the   even be silent for a minute? I swear, my back not enjoying these theater seats, can imagine it bending out of shape like that train, derailing all chaotic. 

> And that one scene, you know... the train just blasting through the screen, lights flashing like those times you’re driving in dense fog, and someone high-beams you, but all around you. It’s like if a cat had opposable thumbs and a license to drive fast things. Intricate and wild!

Oh man! The villain was like a balloon full of secrets ready to pop. Saturday morning cereals full of drama and itchy woolen sweaters. Characters were all over like I swear, if I had a quarter for each double cross, I could probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and still buy dinner. Just pandemonium wrapped in a Twinkie of suspense. 

> textures of scenes still playing behind my eyelids. Must’ve burned through half the popcorn because wow, when they, you know that scene – the WHAM POW with the flickering train lights and the birds – like visions of Dad’s old TV remote thrown onto the carpet in those memorable Christmases. Wasn’t just a  , was a roller-coaster!

At some point, the guy sitting next to me snoozed and snored enough to join in on the explosions. Crazy plot turns, one of the dudes jumping, someone abandoned a whole subplot like leaving groceries in the car. Who even knows what was up with the squawking walkie-talkies – sound tech on something funny, maybe.

> A soup of shots and screams – like every spaghetti western had a disco-dance party in the end. Or when the train zoomed like the after-effects of downing three expressos – it tapped my funny bone somewhere along. I gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, just to connect the dots, like when your dog chases nothings before sleep.

FRIEND screamed to catch the last part over the din of credits rolling. So how does one untangle this? Honest emotion sweep – similar to a turkey rolling through a dance class. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 out for that soundtrack too – killer beats like Grandma’s jukebox refusing to stop.
